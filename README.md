# Functional-Resources


this is a collection of my favourite pappers and books on the functional programming domain 


[The Open Logic Project ](https://openlogicproject.org)- "is a collection of teaching materials on mathematical logic aimed at a non-mathematical audience, intended for use in advanced logic courses as taught in many philosophy departments"

# Category Theory 
[Category Theory: A Gentle Introduction](https://www.logicmatters.net/categories/) that is propably my favourite book on Categories.Peter Smith did an amazing job  

[Seven Sketches in Compositionality: An Invitation to Applied Category Theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.05316)

[What is Applied Category Theory?](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.05923) a very nicely done summary of cateory theory by Tai-Danae Bradley, the creator of [math3ma](https://www.math3ma.com/categories/category-theory)

[What is an Adjunction? Part 1](https://www.math3ma.com/blog/what-is-an-adjunction-part-1)
[What is an Adjunction? Part 2](https://www.math3ma.com/blog/what-is-an-adjunction-part-2)

[A Brisk Tour of (Enriched) Category Theory](https://digitalcommons.oberlin.edu/honors/208/) a great intro into the concept of Enriched Categories

### Categorical Logic 
[Categorical Semantics of Linear Logic](https://www.irif.fr/~mellies//mpri/mpri-ens/biblio/categorical-semantics-of-linear-logic.pdf) my favourite introduction to the concept of Categorical Semantics

# Homotopy Type  Theory

[Introduction to Homotopy Type Theory](https://github.com/EgbertRijke/HoTT-Intro/blob/master/pdfs/2019-summer-school.pdf) my favourite introduction 

[ Homotopy Type Theory](https://homotopytypetheory.org/book/) In this book there are some new Ideas in the Field that combine Topology, Type Theory and Category theory. Those are advanced ideas that are not directly applicable by the practical programmer, but are definitely some beautiful ideas to ponder upon
